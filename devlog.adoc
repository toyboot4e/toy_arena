{toy-arena} is a generational arena for my game development.

== Devlog

* Aug 13, 2021
+
I published {toy-arena} on crates.io. Now it has different policies from {thunderdome}:
+
** {arena-cell} type, where we get mutable access to multple items.
** Slot-based operations are removed. Instead, `Arena::entries_mut` returns a mutable iterator where each entry can be, for example, `remove` ed.
+
Both are unsafe, but I _think_ it doesn't break Rust's safety rule (practically there's no mutable alias, I think).

* Aug 14, 2021
+
I changed all `PhantomData<T>` to `PhantomData<fn() -> T>`
+
I added {DRT} support, following the API of {indextree}.
