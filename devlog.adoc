`toy-arena` is basically a remake of {thunderdome}.

== Motivations

I forked thunderdome for the following motivations:

* Add type parameter `T` to `Index`
* Allow implicit type conversion when inserting item to `Arena`

Then it turned out I want a lot more tweaks:

* Add {arena-cell} type for mutable access to multiple items in `Arena`

* Add support for DRT (directed rooted tree)
+
{indextree} is a bit overkill for implementing scene graph of my game.

* Add distinct type parameter `D` to `Arena<T>`.
+
When we have multiple arenas for the same type of item, we can distinguish the arena types with the container of it:
